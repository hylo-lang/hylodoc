# Front End
This module is responsible for analyzing a given Hylo project, parsing, validation of refernces, and collecting information into the documentation database.

Currently there is a markdown parser imported from https://github.com/johnxnguyen/Down which seemed promising but you can change it in package.swift if you find a better alternative.
